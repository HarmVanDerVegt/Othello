# Othello
Deployment script for Reversi application server.

Please note that this is only testes on a Debian local environment and a Debian target.
This script will not work on any non-Linux environment.

# What does it do
Othello deploys your C# application server on the target of your choice, like an acceptance environment.
It does this in the following way:
  * runs `dotnet publish` locally.
  * zips the output
  * sends the zipped output to your target
  * moves the old deployment currently in /current to /old_releases
  * puts the zipped output in /current
  * unzips the output and removes the zip
  * if there are more old releases than allowed, removes the oldest release
  * kills the running application server, if any
  * starts the new application server
  * deletes the zipped output locally
 
# How to use
